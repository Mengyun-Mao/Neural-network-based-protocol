# Neural-network-based-protocol
The mark in the code is similar to the paper Neural-network-based optimal quantum control of nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation via reverse engineering.
The specific description of the neural network is also in the paper.
You can change the number of hidden units, the connections between neurons and the initialization of the parameters based on your needs.
